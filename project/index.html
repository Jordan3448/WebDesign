    <h1>Welcome to My Page!</h1>
    <p>My name is Jordan D'Angelo. I was born and raised here in Western New York.
    I have 4 pets, two dogs and two cats, all of which I care for very deeply.
    I am a CIS Major and am currently a last semester Senior at Niagara University.
    My main hobbies include Martial Arts and video games. I teach Martial Arts
    three times per week and train myself anywhere from three to four times a week usually.
    When I'm not at school or karate, you can find me playing games on my PC at home.
    My current game of choice is World of Warcraft Classic.</p>
